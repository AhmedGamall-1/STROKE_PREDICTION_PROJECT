4. DATA PREPROCESSING AND FEATURE ENGINEERING
========================================================

4.1 Missing Value Treatment

Problem: BMI column had 201 missing values stored as 'N/A' strings

Solution:
1. Converted 'N/A' strings to proper NaN values
2. Applied intelligent imputation using age-group medians
3. Rationale: BMI varies significantly by age, so age-based imputation is more accurate than overall median

Results: All missing values successfully imputed with medically appropriate values.

4.2 Basic Feature Engineering

The model identifies age as the primary risk factor, followed by cardiovascular disease combinations and metabolic syndrome indicators. This aligns with established medical literature and provides confidence in the model's clinical validity.

While the current model shows promising results, continuous improvement through larger datasets, additional features, and clinical validation will enhance its effectiveness. The ultimate goal is to deploy this tool in real healthcare settings to improve patient outcomes through early stroke risk identification and preventive interventions.
