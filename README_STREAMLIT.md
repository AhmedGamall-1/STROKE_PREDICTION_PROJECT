## üìà Model Training

The model was trained using:
- **Dataset**: Healthcare Dataset Stroke Data (5,110 records)
- **Algorithm Comparison**: 8 different ML algorithms tested
- **Cross-validation**: Stratified K-fold validation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid search optimization
- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE oversampling

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Model files not found**
   - Ensure you've run the complete Jupyter notebook to generate model files
   - Check that all .pkl files are in the same directory as the Streamlit app

2. **Import errors**
   - Install all requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
